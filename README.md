# ISP-Billing
This program takes a usage.txt file (input), and generates a charges.txt (output-bill) for a theoretical ISP user.\
The code for this was difficult to write because parsing strings, and file I/O can be quite complicated in C programming.\
There is no OUPUT.png file for this project, as the output is simply the charges.txt file.
